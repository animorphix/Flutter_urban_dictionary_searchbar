# Urban Dictionary with Flutter 2.1

This is one of my tiny flutter projects based on Urban Dictionary API. In this one I was aiming to implement a search bar, multiple screens and asynchronous api data handling. The code is not perfect at all and the design is pretty lame, but I've worked hard and it's nice to see the result anyway
